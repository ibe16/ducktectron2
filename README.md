# Ducktectron2
 
This is a project developed for the subject Sistemas Inteligentes para la Gesti√≥n en la Empresa of the master degree in computer engineering at UGR. 

The aim of this project is to provide a starting point to use Detectron2 to train your own models. There are two files.
1. Begginers tutorial: [Introduction to Detectron2](https://github.com/ibe16/ducktectron2/blob/master/Introduction_to_Detectron2.ipynb) 
2. Work pipeline to download your own images from Open Image Dataset and train with them: [Duck Detection](https://github.com/ibe16/ducktectron2/blob/master/Introduction_to_Detectron2.ipynb)

All the code is on Google Collaboratory to make easier try it yourself.
